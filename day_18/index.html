      Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
      observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration
      among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the
      Christian liturgical year, it follows the season of Advent (which begins
      four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of
      Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
      culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many
      countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well
      as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the
      holiday season surrounding it. The traditional Christmas narrative
      recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that
      Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When
      Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were
      offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels
      proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word. There are
      different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early
      fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25. This corresponds
      to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. It
      is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of
      the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the
      Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil
      calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the
      Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older
      Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian
      calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the
      form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus'
      exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating
      Christmas.
